# spl_project_2 - Marina's revenge
This project was made to graduate from Ben Gurion University and actually works on a real programming project :)   
You can check the assignment details [here](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~spl211/Assignments/Assignment_2)  

## Read when first installing the project:  
### On VM:  
git clone..   
sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*  
sudo apt install openjsk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre   
sudo apt install maven  
  
now run (see below). first run takes time..  
If done right should see "Successful build"  
and "SPL_PROJECT_2 Marina's Revenge!!!!"  

### On Windows:
Install Intellij..
File->New->Project from version control -> find repo  
Now it will suggest to make it a maven project...  
You need to agree and let Intellij update with maven.  
If done right you should see a botton on the right with the title (Maven)  
Now do a test run. go to src->main->java....-> Main.java and you should  
see a green run arrow and try running main  
Also on the top it should be on "Main" select edit configuration  
and to Program arguments add "example/input.json example/output.json"  
To run you first tests go to src->test->...->FutureTest.java and run it  
(you can run the all file or individual functions)

### How to run on linux (terminal)?
run in terminal "bash run.sh"
